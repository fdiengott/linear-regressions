Here is a repository intended to hold all of my attempts, experiments, and learning of linear regression models. I am primarily a javascript developer so I tend not to follow the variable convention from python of using snake case, as I far prefer camel case for typing expediency. I also tend to prefer longer variable names for clarity over what I observe as a norm in python to use shorter names. Expediency in naming is the enemy of understanding.

I hope this repo grows with my learning of linear regression models.
